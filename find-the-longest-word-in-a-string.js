//Code Explanation

//Take the string and convert it into an array of words. Declare a variable to keep track of the maximum length
//and loop from 0 to the length of the array of words.

//Then check for the longest word by comparing the current word to the previous one and storing the new longest word. 
//At the end of the loop just return the number value of the variable maxLength.
