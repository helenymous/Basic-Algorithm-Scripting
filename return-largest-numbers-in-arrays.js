//Code Explanation

// 1. Create a variable to store the results as an array.

// 2. Create an outer loop to iterate through the outer array.

// 3. Create a second variable to hold the largest number and initialise it with the first number. 
// This must be outside an inner loop so it wonâ€™t be reassigned until we find a larger number.

// 4. Create said inner loop to work with the sub-arrays.

// 5. Check if the element of the sub array is larger than the currently stored largest number. 
// If so, then update the number in the variable.

// 6. After the inner loop, save the largest number in the corresponding position inside of the results array.

// 7. And finally return said array.
