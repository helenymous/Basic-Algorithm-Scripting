// Code Explanation

// Our goal is to take all of the elements from arr1 and insert them into arr2 starting with index position n. 
// At the same time we must ensurethat neither arr or arr2 have been mutated.

// Using the slice() function we can create an exact replica of arr2 and assign the result of the operation 
// to a variable, localArray.

// Now that we have an array that we can mutate on, we can iterate through every item in the first array. 
// For each item in the first array we can use the splice() function to insert the item into index n of localArray.

// We increment the index n by one. This will ensure that every item from the arr1 is inserted into localArray in 
// the proper index position.

// Finally, we return the localArray and end the function.
